# Scraper Example

This is a minimal example of a web scraper that can be used as a "getting started" example as
discussed in the 18-MAY-2021 Meetup.

## Usage

### Setup

First create a virtual environment and activate it

On Mac and Linux

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Then with the virtual environment activated install the requirements

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running

Run the scraper with

```py
python scraper.py
```
